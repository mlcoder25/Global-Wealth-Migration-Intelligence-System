# Global Wealth Migration Intelligence System

This Jupyter Notebook serves as a comprehensive analytical framework for processing, cleaning, and visualizing global wealth migration patterns. It integrates complex datasets to provide actionable insights into how wealth and high-net-worth individuals move across international borders.

## 🚀 Key Functional Modules

### **1. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**

* **Automated Data Loading:** Imports raw migration and economic datasets using `pandas` for high-speed processing.
* **Numerical Standardization:** Cleans financial columns by removing currency symbols and non-numeric characters to prepare data for mathematical modeling.
* **Type Conversion:** Ensures all temporal data and geographical identifiers are correctly typed for accurate time-series analysis.

### **2. Sophisticated Visual Analytics**

* **Interactive Mapping:** Utilizes libraries like `Plotly` or `Folium` to generate heatmaps showing the flow of wealth between specific regions.
* **Trend Analysis:** Includes time-series plots to identify historical patterns in wealth migration from 2010 to the present.
* **Categorical Breakdown:** Provides visual distributions of migration by industry, wealth bracket, and country of origin.

### **3. Intelligence Features**

* **KPI Generation:** Automatically calculates Key Performance Indicators such as Net Migration Rate and Wealth Density per Capita.
* **Filtering Engine:** Allows for deep-dive analysis by filtering data based on specific years, regions, or economic classifications.
